####CLARA FOODS

Clara Foods is reimagining the egg –– starting with egg whites. 

Making them Better. Safer. Customizable. 

By removing the hen from our production, we can eliminate the risk of salmonella and use far less resources to make an egg white that matches the taste, appearance, and culinary properties of traditional egg whites. This makes it a "plug and play" product that can be sold as a stand-alone or inserted in every conceivable application.

Our real advantage, however, is that our egg whites can be tailored to the end consumer. Imagine an egg white that foams twice as much for baking applications. Or one that is hypoallergenic for the 34 million Americans with egg allergies and sensitivities. Or even one that is enriched with a higher nutrient profile.
