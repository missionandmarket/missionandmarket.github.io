####LEO HEALTH

Leo is a new type of pediatric medical practice taking the best of technology, experience, and design, and combining it with the most innovative clinical care to create a different and superior patient care experience for parents and kids.

Leo is not a traditional healthcare company; it is a technology, consumer products, and customer service company. We combine bleeding edge technology, smart ops and spectacular customer service into a holistic and cohesive practice experience.

A Leo family has a wildly different experience managing their child's care. We empower parents with advice and care available from anywhere, the ability to make better decisions through real-time access to data and health information, premium education content, and powerful tools to help coordinate care. 

Our team brings together the best startup, medical and engineering skill sets to execute on a unique business model, positioning us to disrupt an industry that is critical to the well being of millions of parents and children.

We built Leo to address our own needs as parents, making it easier to provide great care for our kids.

Our first practice is launching in NYC in February 2016.
