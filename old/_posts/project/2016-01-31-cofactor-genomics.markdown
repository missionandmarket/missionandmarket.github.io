####COFACTOR GENOMICS

Cofactor's team of past Human Genome Scientists are building the next generation of disease diagnostics using RNA (as opposed to DNA).

RNA is a barometer of health that changes with respect to diet, exercise, infection, and disease. 

At the heart of our approach is software, software that takes complex genetic data and turns it into diagnosis.
