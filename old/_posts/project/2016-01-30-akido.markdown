####AKIDO LABS

Akido Labs is a third-party service that helps health IT app developers simplify the process within each hospital records system. Akido Labs essentially provides the “technical plumbing” for health IT apps. It does this by working with each individual hospital to build a standardized API layer around each system so the developers don’t have to.
