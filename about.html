            <p>A team of entrepreneurs, investors and managers.</p>
            <p>We have different expertise and different networks - which we like to think makes us a 3-in-1 investor with a very high equity-to-value ratio - and are interested in many different sectors within the broader technology space.</p>
            <p>Mission and Market does not have a vertical focus. Our thesis is very simple: if we see value and we find something that we'd like to see in the world, we'll invest. This has led us to invest in the most diverse portfolio we could have imagined, including companies in Virtual Reality, Logistics, Bitcoin, Fintech, Computational Biology, Oncology, Medical Marjuana, Food Biology and more.</p>
            <p>We started Mission and Market because we would like to start all the companies in the world - but we can't. The easiest option is for us to invest in other entrepreneurs as crazy as us and help along the ride.</p>
