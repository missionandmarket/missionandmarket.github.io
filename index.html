            <h4>Capital for founders with bold missions in big markets.</h4>
            <p>Mission and Market is an angel fund backing the most exceptional founders in the SF Bay Area. We invest $25-50k in both angel and seed rounds, and aim to follow on in subsequent financings. We also do selective "chip" AngelList syndicate investments.</p>

            <p>We're looking for scary, extremely risky bets on innovative technology and growing markets.</p>

            <p>Our thesis is simple: fantastic people, with a bold mission, taking big risks in big or new markets. We want entrepreneurs to tell us what the world is going to look like in 5 to 10 years, and why they are the right team to take advantage of that. If we believe, we invest.</p>

            <p>We have a hard no-bullshit policy. We try to minimize the time it takes for us to give a decision and wire the money, often sending wires the day after our first meeting.</p>
