####BENTO

Bento provides delicious asian food delivered in minutes.

We believe that you should not have to choose between eating healthy and conveniently. Bento delivers delicious Asian food in minutes in San Francisco.
Using our app, customers start building their Bento by choosing a main dish. We have three options, that rotate daily. Next customers choose four side dishes. We have six to eight side options, that also rotate daily.
The menu focuses on Asian-inspired food with dishes like Korean short ribs, Japanese eggplant, dragon roll, seaweed salad, okonomiyaki, and gyoza.
After placing an order, customers track their server’s location and progress. They’ll meet our server curbside, grab their Bento, and it’s time to eat!
Our patent pending packaging enables this system allowing for delivery in an average of 15 minutes.
Since launch we have seen double-digit W/W growth.
