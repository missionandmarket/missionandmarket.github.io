####Padlet

Padlet is the easiest way to create and collaborate in the world. A padlet is a blank page where you can put any content - text, images, videos, documents - collaboratively with other people. It's like MSPaint for the web.

The product is so simple, 5 year olds are using it. So are 65 year olds. In fact, millions of people use Padlet every month for everything from sharing files to brainstorming to building websites. We are used by schools, offices, churches, governments, and even zoos and police stations!

More importantly, people who use Padlet absolutely love it. And love is a good thing.
