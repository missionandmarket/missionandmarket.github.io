####Asseta

Asseta is fundamentally changing the way manufacturers purchase and sell manufacturing parts and equipment by providing a centralized platform to a fragmented and opaque market. Asseta is going after a $200B industry that has been controlled by brokers and liquidators for over 20 years.

Our strategy is to focus on high customer usage and to integrate our product with customers' systems to build and scale the marketplace.

Our mission is to enable the next generation of hardware pioneers by lowering the barriers of entry for manufacturing. There's currently hundreds of millions of dollars worth of idle equipment sitting in warehouses collecting dust that thousands of companies and entrepreneurs would love to have access to. We believe connecting these two groups will change the world.
