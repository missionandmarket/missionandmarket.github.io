####Seed

SEED is a business banking solution for the modern era. Founded by Brian Merritt and Ryan Hildebrand, former executives at consumer banking startup Simple, SEED is a new kind of business banking service that employs cutting-edge technology and a community bank service model to give founders the tools they need to manage their businesses like pros. SEED offers FDIC insurance, as well as free domestic wire transfers, free ACH transactions, free check sending, and low cost international payments.

Unlike traditional banks, SEED is designed to scale with any business. Its mobile-first, API-driven design means that businesses can tailor SEED to fit their needs and their business workflow in the office and on the go.

SEED is working with its first members now and is available via invite only in the US.
