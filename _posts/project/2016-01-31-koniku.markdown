####KONIKU

Koniku’s mission is to harness the power of Neurons.

Neurons are massively parallel computational devices capable of processing contextual, poorly formed, multidimensional data more efficiently than any computer available.

Our hardware is designed to take advantage of these natural benefits to use real neurons in a robust, reproducible and addressable way in order to define an architecture that is capable of tackling problems in visual processing, data processing, and pattern recognition.
