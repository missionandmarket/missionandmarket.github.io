####Transcriptic

Transcriptic is building a revolutionary laboratory virtualization platform: "cloud computing" for the life sciences. We've developed machine-readable protocol and robotics technology for carrying out experiments quickly, cheaply, and highly repeatably. We remove the need for on-site infrastructure, decimating costs and freeing up the endless days spent moving small volumes of liquids around by hand.
