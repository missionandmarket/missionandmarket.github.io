####Enlitic

Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Our mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors' notes, and structured lab tests. Our day-to-day work covers cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly exciting opportunities for helping the developing world. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers.
